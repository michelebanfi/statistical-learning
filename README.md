# Weather forecast using statistical learning
 
The aim of the project was to implement a statistical learning model such as `XGBoosting` or `Random Forest` in `R` on a dataset of choice. The chosen dataset was a weather historic dataset, 
from which the relation between contiguos observation was ignored; treating the problem as it wasn't a time series.
